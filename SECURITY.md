# Security Policy

The MemMachine team takes the security of our project and its users very
seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and others who
work to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We have enabled GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature for this
repository. This is the preferred method for reporting security vulnerabilities.

**Please DO NOT create a public GitHub issue.** Publicly disclosing a
vulnerability may put the community at risk.

To report a vulnerability, please visit the
[Security tab](https://github.com/MemMachine/MemMachine/security) of our
repository and click on "Report a privately reported vulnerability". We will
acknowledge your report within 2 business days and work with you to understand
the issue and coordinate a resolution.

## Guidelines for Reporting

To help us more effectively and quickly address the vulnerability, please
include the following information in your report:

- **Description:** A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** A minimal, reproducible code snippet or steps that can
  be used to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- **Environment:** The operating system, library version, and any other relevant
  details.
- **Expected Behavior:** A description of what you expected to happen without
  the vulnerability.

### Supported Versions

We are committed to providing security updates for the latest stable version of
MemMachine.

- **Latest Major Version (e.g., v1.x.y):** We will provide security patches and
  fixes for any security vulnerabilities in this version.
- **Previous Major Versions:** We will not provide security patches for older
  versions. Please upgrade to the latest version to ensure you are protected.

## Public Disclosure

We believe in coordinated, responsible disclosure. Once a vulnerability is
reported, we will work to validate and fix the issue. We will then announce the
vulnerability and the fix in a public GitHub Security Advisory, giving credit to
the reporter unless they wish to remain anonymous. We ask that reporters do not
disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have released a fix.
