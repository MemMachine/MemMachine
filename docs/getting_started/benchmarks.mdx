Welcome to the MemMachine evaluation toolset! We've created a simple tool to help you measure the performance, response quality, and benchmark accuracy scores(LoCoMo, HotpotQA, WikiMultiHop) of your MemMachine instance.

**Benchmark Guide:** For the latest benchmark commands (retrieval-agent and legacy episodic workflows), see the [Evaluation README](https://github.com/MemMachine/MemMachine/blob/main/evaluation/README.md).
