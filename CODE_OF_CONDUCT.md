# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free and welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Reporting Guidelines

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team via a private channel on GitHub. To do so, please file a report via the [Security tab](https://github.com/MemMachine/MemMachine/security) on our repository. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

We use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature for security concerns. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in MemMachine, **please DO NOT create a public GitHub issue**. Instead, please report it via the [Security tab](https://github.com/MemMachine/MemMachine/security) on our repository and click on "Report a privately reported vulnerability."

All project leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement

Project leaders will follow the enforcement guidelines from the Contributor Covenant to address each incident. A project leader who does not follow the Code of Conduct will face the same consequences as any other member of the community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html).
